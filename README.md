# iCaddy

The application allows users to input a shot by selecting what club they used and what distance that they hit the ball. The application will return the average distance for that specific club.

- Utilized `formik` and `yup` to handle validation and submission
- Worked with JSON web tokens to handle user authentication
- Utilized `axios` which would allow me to intercept requests and add the user's web token to grant user access
- Redirect users to dashboard from the log in page if they have a valid token
- Utilized `react-router` to manage various pages of the application and handle redirects
- Utilized `react-select` to create and style dropdown menu
- Worked with `scss` and `bootstrap` for styling
