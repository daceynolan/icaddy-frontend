# iCaddy

### Purpose

I recently started playing golf, and in order to determine which club I should use to hit each shot, I started writing down the distances I hit each of my clubs on average. The problem with this approach was it quickly became a hassle to continue to add up and average all of my shots.

iCaddy is a pocket caddy that allows a user to create an account and log shots theyâ€™ve hit with various golf clubs to a backend service. The application calculates the average distance for each club used over time to allow a user to make informed decisions about what club to use on the course.

### Development focus

- Use `formik` to handle the state management of form data and yup to handle validation
- Create `axios` instance to standardize config and append authorization headers to all outgoing requests
- Implement `useContext` hook to handle the stored user session throughout the application
- Use `react-router` to handle routes and navigation
- Configure create-react-app to support Sass
- Use `Sass` to standardize colors, spacing, and other common styles
- Authorize user requests using a stored JSON web token
